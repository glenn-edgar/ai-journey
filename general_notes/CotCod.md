# Chain-of-Thought vs Chain-of-Draft: Core Concepts

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

* **Approach**: Guides AI through explicit, step-by-step reasoning processes
* **Purpose**: Enhances accuracy in complex reasoning tasks (math, logic, multi-step problems)
* **Key Features**:
  * Verbose intermediate steps mimicking human cognition
  * Requires 70-189 tokens per query
  * Better for tasks needing transparency in reasoning

## Chain-of-Draft (CoD)

* **Approach**: Uses concise, minimal-step reasoning inspired by human note-taking
* **Purpose**: Optimizes efficiency without sacrificing accuracy
* **Key Features**:
  * 92% fewer tokens than CoT (14.3 vs 189.4 tokens)
  * 76% faster response times
  * Maintains or improves accuracy through focused reasoning

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | CoT | CoD |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Token Usage | High (70-189 tokens) | Low (7-14 tokens) |
| Accuracy | 91-93% | 91-97% |
| Latency | 50-75% slower | Real-time capable |
| Cost/Query | $0.01-$0.038 | $0.008-$0.01 |
| Best For | Educational tools, complex analysis | Mobile AI, customer support, IoT |

## Technical Differences

### Reasoning Structure

* **CoT**:
```python
# Traditional math solution
apples_initial = 20
apples_remaining = 12
apples_given = apples_initial - apples_remaining
print(f"Apples given: {apples_given}")  # Explicit steps
```

* **CoD**:
```python
# Optimized solution
print(20-12)  # Direct computation
```

### Implementation

* **CoT** requires explicit prompting templates:
```
Q: [Problem]
A: Step 1...
   Step 2...
   Final Answer: [Result]
```

* **CoD** uses constrained prompts:
```
MAX_WORDS=5 → "20-12=8"
```

## Practical Applications

### CoT Use Cases
* Mathematical proofs
* Legal document analysis
* Multi-hop question answering

### CoD Use Cases
* Real-time customer support bots
* Edge computing on IoT devices
* High-frequency trading analysis

## Evolution Timeline

1. 2022: CoT introduced by Google researchers
2. 2024: Widespread adoption in enterprise AI
3. 2025: CoD developed by Zoom researchers, showing 92.4% efficiency gains

## Future Outlook

CoD is becoming preferred for production systems due to:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: $3,800 → $760/month per million queries
2. **Sustainability**: Reduced energy consumption per query
3. **Performance**: Equal/better accuracy with 7.6% word count

A nontrivial example
COT Input text


#### first set of instructions

design a python module which has the following functions

Start_Definition()
Initializes the Definition Dictionary

Define_Action_Functions( List_of_Action_Functions)
Defines a list of Action Functions which can be used
Must be the first function that is called after Start_Definition

Start_Verb_Definition( Name, Help_String, Action_Function )
Name - String
Help_String - String
Action_function -String

The Function cannot be called within a Start_Verb_Definition 
The Function can be called once an End_Verb_Definitin or End_Object_Definition is called

This function adds to the definition dictionary an entry with key the Name Variable and the entry a dictionary with the fields
    name - string
     help -string
     action - string
      objects -- empty dictionary
      adjectives -- empty dictionary
Note the dictionary entry must not have been previously defined

End_Verb_Definition()
  -- clears verb definition and allows new verbs to be defined
End_Definition()
  -- Definition Dictionary is returned as a json object

Generate Python code with naming and variable names according to Python Style Guide

     

#### second set of instructions

Add the following functions

Add_Adverb(name,description)
   This function is valid only during verb definition
   This function added to the adverb list of the verb definition a dictionary element
     entry  name,   name must not be previously defined
     dictionary element
         name - name
         description -- description
              Note description field can be blank  
           
#### Third Set of Instructions
Add the following functions



Define_Object( name, description )
  Will add an entry to the verbs object dictionary the following entry
   name name
   description description
   adjective empty dictionary
   name must be unique to the in the object dictionary 
   
   Define_Object cannot be called again until End_Object is called
   Also End_Verb cannot be called until End_Object is called

Add_Adjective(name,description)
    function adds an entry to the adjective dictionary field of object
     entry must not have been previously called
      Function can only be called in the scope of Define Object
End_Object_Defintion()
   Terminates Object Definition context


##########################  End of Definitions
###### Error found correction instructions
In the function 

 def add_adverb(self, name, description):
        """Add an adverb to the current verb's adjectives dictionary."""
        if not self._is_defining_verb:
            raise DefinitionError("Can only add adverbs during an active verb definition.")
        if self._is_defining_object:
            raise DefinitionError("Cannot add adverbs while defining an object.")
        if not isinstance(name, str) or not isinstance(description, str):
            raise DefinitionError("Name and description must be strings.")
        
        current_adjectives = self._definition_dict[self._current_verb]["adjectives"]
        if name in current_adjectives:
            raise DefinitionError(f"Adverb '{name}' is already defined for verb '{self._current_verb}'.")
        
        current_adjectives[name] = {
            "name": name,
            "description": description
        }

self._definition_dict[self._current_verb]["adjectives"] should be self._definition_dict[self._current_verb]["adverbs"]

This affects the define_verb function

COD Output

I'll translate the Chain of Thought (CoT) design instructions into a more structured Chain of Derivation (CoD) format. This will make the logical flow and dependencies more explicit.
Chain of Derivation: Python Module Definition System
	1. Purpose: Design a Python module for creating structured definition dictionaries. [premise]
	2. Module should manage a definition dictionary with specific hierarchical structure. [premise]
	3. The module needs state tracking for definition contexts (verb definition active, object definition active). [derived from functionality descriptions]
	4. The module requires error handling for context violations. [derived from restrictions in instructions]
	5. Core functions needed: 
		○ start_definition()
		○ define_action_functions()
		○ start_verb_definition()
		○ end_verb_definition()
		○ add_adverb()
		○ define_object()
		○ add_adjective()
		○ end_object_definition()
		○ end_definition() [list compiled from instructions]
	6. Definition dictionary structure: 

Copy
{
  "verb_name": {
    "name": string,
    "help": string,
    "action": string,
    "objects": { ... },
    "adverbs": { ... }
  }
}
[derived from function descriptions]
	7. Object definition structure: 

Copy
"object_name": {
  "name": string,
  "description": string,
  "adjectives": { ... }
}
[derived from function descriptions]
	8. Context restrictions: 
		○ define_action_functions() must be called immediately after start_definition() [instruction]
		○ start_verb_definition() cannot be nested [instruction]
		○ add_adverb() only valid during verb definition [instruction]
		○ define_object() only valid during verb definition [instruction]
		○ define_object() cannot be nested [instruction]
		○ add_adjective() only valid during object definition [instruction]
		○ end_verb_definition() cannot be called during object definition [instruction] [all from specified restrictions]
	9. Name uniqueness constraints: 
		○ Verb names must be unique in definition dictionary [instruction]
		○ Adverb names must be unique within a verb [instruction]
		○ Object names must be unique within a verb [instruction]
		○ Adjective names must be unique within an object [instruction] [derived from "must not have been previously defined" constraints]
	10. Data type constraints: 
		○ All names and descriptions must be strings [implied standard] [derived from parameter types]
	11. Error found: add_adverb() incorrectly stores adverbs in the "adjectives" dictionary rather than an "adverbs" dictionary. [from error correction instructions]
	12. Therefore, the verb definition structure should contain an "adverbs" dictionary, not use "adjectives" for storing adverbs. [from 11]
	13. The implementation must follow Python Style Guide (PEP 8) for naming and variables. [instruction]
	14. The completed module should handle all stated constraints and provide clear error messages for context violations. [implied requirement]
	15. The module should return the complete definition dictionary as a JSON object when end_definition() is called. [from function description]
This Chain of Derivation clearly outlines the logical structure of the module requirements, the relationships between different functions, and the constraints that need to be enforced. It makes explicit the hierarchical nature of the definition system and highlights the correction needed for the adverb storage issue.

'll implement the Python module based on the Chain of Derivation (CoD) specifications. This module will handle creating structured definition dictionaries with verbs, objects, adverbs, and adjectives.
Definition Module
Click to open code
Tap to open
The Python module has been implemented according to the Chain of Derivation (CoD) specifications. Let me explain the key aspects of this implementation:
Core Structure and Design
I've created a DefinitionManager class that manages the entire definition creation process. This class maintains internal state to track context (like whether we're currently defining a verb or an object) and provides methods that correspond to each required function in the specifications.
The implementation follows these key principles from the CoD:
	1. State Management: The class tracks multiple states: 
		○ Whether definition has been started
		○ Whether action functions have been defined
		○ Whether we're currently defining a verb
		○ Whether we're currently defining an object
		○ Which verb and object are currently active
	2. Hierarchical Structure: The definition dictionary has the hierarchical structure exactly as specified, with verbs containing objects and adverbs, and objects containing adjectives.
	3. Context Enforcement: Each method checks the current context before proceeding, ensuring that operations can only happen in the appropriate context (for example, you can only add adverbs during verb definition).
	4. Error Handling: I've created a custom DefinitionError exception class to provide clear error messages when constraints are violated.
Important Implementation Details
	1. Method Chaining: All methods return self to allow for method chaining, making the API more fluent and easier to use.
	2. Input Validation: Each method validates its inputs, checking types and uniqueness constraints.
	3. Adverbs Correction: As specified in the error correction section, I've implemented adverbs to be stored in an "adverbs" dictionary rather than "adjectives".
	4. Context Restrictions: I've implemented all the context restrictions from point 8 in the CoD, ensuring functions can only be called in the appropriate context.
	5. PEP 8 Compliance: The code follows Python Style Guide (PEP 8) for naming conventions and code structure.
Example Usage
At the bottom of the file, I've included an example function create_definition() that demonstrates how to use the DefinitionManager class to create a definition dictionary. This example:
	1. Creates verbs ("print" and "save")
	2. Adds adverbs to each verb
	3. Defines objects for the "print" verb
	4. Adds adjectives to those objects
	5. Properly ends all definitions
	6. Returns the final JSON result
This implementation faithfully captures all the requirements and constraints specified in the Chain of Derivation, including the correction for the adverb storage issue.
